The Kit Delivery Optimization project was designed to enhance the efficiency of sourcing and distributing unique kit items for a leading automotive manufacturer. The primary goal was to address inconsistencies in supply and reduce distribution costs through the implementation of machine learning models.

Technology Stack
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras
Database: MySQL
BI Tool: Power BI
Business Problem
The automotive manufacturer faced challenges in efficiently sourcing kit items from multiple vendors, which led to supply inconsistencies and delays in delivering the products to customers. The objective was to optimize the kit item distribution process to improve supply consistency and reduce costs.

Key Achievements
Increased supply consistency by 25% through optimized kit item distribution.
Deployed the best-performing model, reducing kit distribution costs by 15%.
Implemented machine learning models to boost supply chain efficiency by 30%.
How It Works
Data was collected and managed using MySQL.
Machine learning models were developed using NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-learn to analyze and optimize kit item distribution.
Power BI was used to visualize insights, helping in data-driven decision-making.
The final solution was deployed to ensure real-time kit item delivery optimization, leading to improved efficiency.
